# Scheduler

This is a scheduling desktop user interface application for a software company that conducts business in multiple languages and has its main offices in different time zones. The application uses a MySQL database that it pulls data from. 

## Motivation

This application is a result of one of my CS courses. A specific scenario was provided along with specific business requirements. I had to create an application that would satisfy the customer's needs. 

## Code Style / Tech / Framework

Standard Java in Netbeans IDE 8.2

## Features

Each time a user logs in, their login time and username is written to a .txt file. Each user has his/her own .txt file with a filename that is the user's username.

## Issues

1. Closing the Customer Records screen ends the entire program.
2. Cancelling the Update Appointment screen ends the program with an error.

## Installing

Complete...

```
Example
```
(End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo)
